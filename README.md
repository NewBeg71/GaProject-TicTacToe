# Project 1/GA-WDI-PROV/TicTacToe
URL for deployed game: https://newbeg71.github.io/GaProject-TicTacToe/index.html

## Objectives

- Command Line: Interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
  * Complete and comfortable - need to learn more commands/shortcuts, as well as, trouble shooting
- Source Control: Managing and interacting with a git repository to store changes to code.
  * Complete, however, despite being comfortable with this, I managed to lose work.  Need to understand branches
  & origins better
- Programming Fundamentals: Working with objects, constructors, and events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- Web Fundamentals: Structuring, styling, and animating documents within a browser; responding to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- Browser Applications: Using AJAX to connect to a back-end application.
  * Working on it, probably will not be completed
- Server Applications: We haven't covered a ton of server-side technologies yet (that's up next), but we learned a bit about how API endpoints work, and how to get data from them.
- Security: With JavaScript closures, scratching the surface of why security matters.
  * Will not even atempt.  I know there is issues with api's and ssh keys.
- Deployment: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment (GitHub Pages)
  * Complete - just to make sure all my repo files are properly connected
- Products and Teams: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.
  * Need better commits and much better posting of issues, including researching the issues that have
  already been posted

## Goals

- Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
  * Complete
- Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
  * Complete
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
  * Complete.  With difficulty!  Need greater understanding of VC (ie GitHib) and
  modular programming.  Need to test more often.
- - Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
  * Almost Complete.  api is a problem
- Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
  * Almost Complete.  Want to have game follow my original logic (see earlier commits).
  I want the player to click an image, which represents the players turn then allows that
  player turn to click a '.cell' and have that image placed in it.

## Bonus

- Compete from separate devices)
  * Not even close - future endeavor
- Communicate with a back-end (which we'll provide for you) to store the state of your game.
  * Working on it (August 3, 2017) - not even close

## Design Responsibly
### Need to complete

- A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
  * follow this link: http://framebox.org/ACMEl-bKAMVC
- The data structure you plan to use.
  * in each file (ie html/css/js) I plan on writing out the psuedo code for each 'process'
  then code out the logic in small pieces and first correct atom linter errors.  When free
  of errors test in Chrome Developer Tools.  Once I learn grunt (ie grunt test) test
  it in the local server
- How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  * Learn boostrap and represent the containers in html w/ simple styling
- How you plan to approach this project.
  * patience/learning new tools to make my life easier
- 4-8 user stories for your game project.
  * How to make it interesting, after all it is a simple game easily played on the back of
  a napkin
  * How do you find somebody to play on-line and make it a social networking tools
  * Need simple clear format so it can be played on multiple devices (ie on phone
    while riding the bus)
  * Track how you perform against multiple users (how smart are you: http://www.wikihow.com/Win-at-Tic-Tac-Toe)
- How you plan to keep your code modular.
  * I know this is the wrong answer! Just do things in small steps in the original
  file.  This has always created issues, yet I am stubborn and continue to do it .
  Creates files that are always commented out.  It makes it difficult to debug and I
  am sure it creates longer upload times.
- What creative spin will you add to your project?
  * Try to create sensual interaction (ie music, images and moving graphics)
- How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
  * With better commit messages
- Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
  * Yes, time permitting

## Resources

* http://framebox.org/ACMEl-bKAMVC - for wire-framing instead of a picture of sketch
* https://www.w3schools.com/ - even though it is outdated I like following the examples
to see exactly how the work (The bootstrap section was much better help than bootstrap's
own site)
* StackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com/ - can be confusing because the various answer and their level of complexity,
however if you take your time you can usually find what you are looking for
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
* http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/ - Need to get more
involved in this site

## Take Away

 * Follow Instructions (& take your time to read and understand them).  I do well
 with codeacademy, etc, but fall apart when programming from scratch, because I am
 need to learn more about REPL and Chrome developer tools
 * Take my time (& sometimes step away - its amazing that after five hours a five minute walk
   leads to a revelation)
 * KISS (the story of my Life - thanks Buck) - I over think things.  Stick with
 what I know and the rest will come and make my life easier and my code cleaner
 * Learn keyboard shortcuts for everything (especially atom and git) - have bookmarked
 sites, however, ask for help creating something in CL (ask Ben, Danny or Christian M)
 * Clean up comments and unused code frequently - ie with each commit
 * Go over everything, whether it works or not, and understand why it worked or did not
 (then review, look at solution branch, and correct my mistakes)
 * Still need to learn to navigate around a Mac (see shortcuts)
 * Establish better typing skills

## Plans for the Game

  * Clean up alert message and timing of updating the placement of X's and O's
  * Replace X's and O's with images - dead and buffet logos - tried suggestion from peer (Nick)
  and copied link from GitHub and it id not work - I beleive I know the problem
  * Create a "Game Landing Page" then have it point to this game, expanded memory game,
  boggle and hangman (from first cohort)
  * Spend more time with styling - I like it!
