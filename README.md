# Project 1/GA-WDI-PROV/TicTacToe

## Objectives

- Command Line: Interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- Source Control: Managing and interacting with a git repository to store changes to code.
- Programming Fundamentals: Working with objects, constructors, and events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- Web Fundamentals: Structuring, styling, and animating documents within a browser; responding to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- Browser Applications: Using AJAX to connect to a back-end application.
- Server Applications: We haven't covered a ton of server-side technologies yet (that's up next), but we learned a bit about how API endpoints work, and how to get data from them.
- Security: With JavaScript closures, scratching the surface of why security matters.
- Deployment: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment (GitHub Pages)
- Products and Teams: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.

## Goals

- Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
- Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
- - Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
- Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete

## Bonus

- Compete from separate devices)
- Communicate with a back-end (which we'll provide for you) to store the state of your game.

## Design Responsibly
### Need to complete

- A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
- The data structure you plan to use.
- How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
- How you plan to approach this project.
- 4-8 user stories for your game project.
- How you plan to keep your code modular.
- What creative spin will you add to your project?
- How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
- Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
